# Monokai Green Theme Variation
A simple VSCode dark theme based on Monokai.

# History
I just hated the Monokai's orignal yellish look os the strings. Usually we use a lot of strings in our code and yellow color just pissed me off so I decided to change it to green and made this dark theme.

# Docs & Contribute
To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.

# Tweaks
If you would like to play around with new colors, use the setting workbench.colorCustomizations to customize the currently selected theme.
I recommend you enable custom titleBar and menu for linux/Windows - add `"window.titleBarStyle": "custom"` to your settings.
