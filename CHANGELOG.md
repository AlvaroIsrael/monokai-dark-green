## **0.1.3** - 2020-11-14
### Added
- Changed selection color from #3C3F41 to #4B6EAE.
- Hidden wordHighlightStrongBackground flag color beacuse it was really annoying, if you wish you can overwrite that by editing "editor.wordHighlightStrongBackground": "#FFFFFF" in vscode editor settings.
- Switched active and inactive tabs background colors. They were reversed by my mistake and when I tryed programming using react on vcscode it really bugged my brain. Everytime I wanted to switch between tabs I was choosing the wrong one.
- Updated theme logo icon and preview image.
- Updated README.md file
